This is a simple script to get a return value for an object close to the player.

Depending on what object you have closest to the player it returns a "key" e.g. "atm" if you are close to one of the defined atm props.

This also works for objects which have been mapped as an addition for the server.

No need to drive through the whole map to find all bins or atms to save them in a database or hardcode some colshapes.
